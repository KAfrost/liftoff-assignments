## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project is management tools for my custom stainless steel tumbler business. I want to provide a route for customers to not only place an order but to also be able to view the status of their order on their profile, as well as being able to check if there are any open slots in my work list to be able to place an order right away.  

### Features
User Login: Users can create accounts a log in to place and view orders.
Public Worklist: Viewers will be able to see the status of my current worklist without having to log in.
Place Order: After loging in users will be able to communicate their choices for their cup orders. - at time of MVP invoices for purchase will be sent ourside of the application, but I would evenetually like to connect my order function to Paypal so that this will be automatic.
Admin Management: The admin will be able to view the entire worklist and edit it's status to be communicated to the User. 

### Technologies
C#, .Net, Entity

### What I'll Have to Learn
Right now I'm not positive what skills I'll have to expand on inorder to make at the very least the MVP happen, other planned upgrades will require connecting with the PayPal API, and this might end up requiring the entire projet to be reweitten in another language for all I know.
